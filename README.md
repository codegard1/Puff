# Puff
Scripts and other files related to storage and analysis of data from my vape. 

## Gist
I use an [Orion DNA mod](https://lostvape.com/product-item/orion-dna-go-pod-kit/), which records detailed information about each puff. 

The SSIS packages have been deprecated because SSIS is a nightmare. 

Currently I'm using PowerShell to import data from the Orion REST service directly to the SQL server. 

## TO DO
- Organize project directory better
- Resolve redundant /duplicate files
- Capture all scripts used to provision and populate the Puff database
